/**
 * A sample application that demonstrates how to use the MQTT v3 Client api in
 * non-blocking waiter mode.
 * 
 * It can be run from the command line in one of two modes: 
 *  - as a publisher, sending a single message to a topic on the server
 *  - as a subscriber, listening for messages from the server
 *  
 *  There are three versions of the sample that implement the same features
 *  but do so using using different programming styles:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>Sample (this one) which uses the API which blocks until the operation completes</li>
 *  <li>SampleAsyncWait shows how to use the asynchronous API with waiters that block until 
 *  an action completes</li>
 *  <li>SampleAsyncCallBack shows how to use the asynchronous API where events are
 *  used to notify the application when an action completes<li>
 *  </ol>
 *  
 *  If the application is run with the -h parameter then info is displayed that 
 *  describes all of the options / parameters.
