# Usage

The view can be accessed by navigating to Window -> Show View -> Other..., then expand the "M2M" folder and select "MQTT Tester View".  This will open the interface for the MQTT view.  The interface consists of three tabs: Connection, Publish, and Subscribe.

**Connection Tab**

This tab is used to connect the MQTT client to a broker.  A connection must be established in order to publish and subscribe in the remaining tabs.  Here is a brief description of the fields:

 * Broker Address: (Required) The IP address or URL of the broker
 * Broker Port:    (Required) The port number of the broker
 * Client ID:      (Required) A unique identifier to connect with.
 * Username:       A username, if required by the broker.
 * Password:       A password, if required by the broker.
 * Keep Alive:     (Required) The number of seconds between keep alive pings sent to the broker.
 * Clean Start:    Whether or not to maintain subscriptions across disconnects.
 * LWT Enable:     Whether to enable Last Will and Testament (LWT).
 * LWT Topic:      The topic that the broker will publish the LWT on.
 * LWT Message:    The message that the broker will publish for the LWT.
 * LWT QoS:	The quality of service that the LWT will be published on.
 * LWT Retain:	Whether to retain the LWT message.

**Publish Tab**

Used to publish messages to the broker.  A message may be a string or a File.  Here is a brief description of the fields:

 * Topic:	 The topic to publish on.
 * QoS:     The quality of service to publish on.
 * Retain:  Whether to retain the message on the broker.
 * Payload: The payload to publish (if publishing a string).
 * File:    The file to publish (if publishing a file).

**Subscribe Tab**

Used to subscribe and unsubscribe on topics.  Once the client is subscribed to a topic, all messages received will be displayed in the log below.  Here is a brief description of the fields:

 * Topic: The topic to subscribe on (can include wildcards + and #)
